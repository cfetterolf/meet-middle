# Meet in the Middle

You want to meet up with a friend at a bar or restaurant in a convinient location for both of you (or all three, four, etc.), but are tired of manually sifting through Yelp and Google reviews. 

Enter me, this application.  I will find the 10 highest rated places that are fairly equidistant from both people's locations.
Optimized for mobile as well, for use on the go.  

Tech stack:

React (CRA), Node.js/Express, Heroku.  If in the future we want notifications/accounts, then also Firebase.

APIs: Google Maps (distance/routing), Google Places (reviews).
